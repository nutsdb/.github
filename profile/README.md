## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

NutsDB is a simple, fast, embeddable, persistent key/value store written in pure Go. 
It supports fully serializable transactions and many data structures such as list, set, sorted set.

## Hope to build nutsdb together

I found that I don't have enough energy and ability to do nutsdb. I hope to attract more developers, especially those who are professional in this field. The development of nutsdb is still very early. When you join, the threshold for joining is very low. As long as you can go, even Itâ€™s okay if you donâ€™t, just learn it. The most important thing is that you have enthusiasm, willingness, and learning ability. This project has great potential. Letâ€™s create a well-known project together! If you have an idea, chat with me privately !

Main directions: 
* 1. Database engine direction 
* 2. Tool ecology such as cli, visualization tools, etc.   
* 3. Document construction, etc.
